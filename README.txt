Inference In Bayesian Networks

assignment course Algorithmic Decisions

3 Algorithms for Inference:

1 - simple inference using CPT - conditional probability table
2 - variable elimination - join factor's and eliminate variables by alphabet order
3 - variable elimination - join factor's and eliminate variables by different heuristic - ordered by the number of rows each variable shown in the factors
