# Inference In Bayesian Networks

Algorithmic Decisions course assignment  


3 Algorithms for Inference:

* simple inference using CPT - conditional probability table
* variable elimination - join factor's and eliminate variables by alphabet order
* variable elimination - join factor's and eliminate variables by different heuristic - ordered by the number of rows each variable shown in the factors
